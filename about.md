### **I’m Dan, a web designer living in Cleveland, Ohio.**

I’ve been designing and building websites for over fifteen years. I’m passionate about making good design, learning cutting-edge tech, pushing innovation, and improving experiences.

More recently, I co-founded a web startup, [Tackk Inc](/tackk), and built web services and apps for millions of users.

Creating simple, well-designed, fast digital products for the world to use makes me happy.
