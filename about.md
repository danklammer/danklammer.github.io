### **I'm Dan, a designer &amp; front-end coder from Cleveland, Ohio.**

Iâ€™ve been designing and building websites and apps for over fifteen years. I am passionate about everything design and the web.

More recently, I co-founded a web startup&mdash;raising over 3 million dollars to build apps for millions of users. From the business decision making, to UX and UI, to product development, I've had my hands in it all.

My true love is in creating simple, well-designed, super fast digital products for everyone to enjoy.
