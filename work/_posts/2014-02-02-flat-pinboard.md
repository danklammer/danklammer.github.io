I recently signed up for [Pinboard.in], *the anti-social bookmarking site*, to get away from all the social linking out there. I wanted a simple but flexible solution to store my links. Nothin’ crazy… Pinboard was *almost exactly* what I was looking for. I am a big fan of the site’s principles—focusing on being fast, flexible, reliable, and giving the user 100% control over their data. But as a designer, the one thing I felt was missing was that extra polish and balance in the design… So I created the (almost) Flat Pinboard theme—keeping it minimal but making it more balanced and current.

Right now the theme is only optimized for Chrome, and you will need the [Stylish Chrome Extension] for it to work.
