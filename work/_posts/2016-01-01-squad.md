Squad is an [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1043626975) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tackk.squad) app I helped design while at [Tackk](/tackk). The core function of the app is to give you live on-demand status updates from your closest groups of friends, one-hour at a time.

Squad has become very popular with teens. Within 6 months of launching, Squad has been downloaded over 400 thousand times and has had over 2 million status updates posted.

My role in the project was creating the logo, brand, wireframes, prototypes, and marketing materials.
