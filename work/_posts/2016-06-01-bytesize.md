#### **A Passion Project**

Bytesize is a passion project I started to help learn the [SVG spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/), particularly [SVG Paths](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Paths) and how they are drawn within code.

Each icon is hand-coded along a 32x32 grid, and uses SVG `stroke` allowing for maximum style flexibility; meaning you can adjust the weight, color, size, and if you want the edges to be round or square.

While designing and coding these icons, I tried to place as few points as possible to keep the shapes simple but also to reduce on file size. All 75+ icons measure in at 9KB minified (2KB in SVGZ, or Gzipped).

Check out a demo of Bytesize and what I learned while creating them in my post, [SVG Icons FTW](/articles/svg-icons-ftw). Also free free to use any of these icons on your next project. Everything is available on the [Bytesize GitHub page](https://github.com/danklammer/bytesize-icons)!
