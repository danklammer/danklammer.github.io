#### **Simply create beautiful pages**

I co-founded Tackk with Eric Bockmuller in 2013 with the mission to empower everyone with the ability to instantly create, publish and share beautiful content on the web.

Since officially launching in 2013, there have been over 50 million visits to users' created Tackk pages. Tackk has been featured on [PCWorld], [TechCrunch], [AppStorm], and many other publications.

Tackk has become especially popular with teachers and educators, allowing students to have fun publishing their school projects with the rest of the classroom... and world!


#### **Other products**

While at Tackk Inc, I also played in a major part in creating other apps including the [Tackk mobile app], [Squad], and [Wink].
